  name: Component Shopper
  background: |
    An electronics hobbyist building a BLE direction-finding device.
    Has a specific bill of materials and needs to add exact parts to
    shopping carts on Adafruit and Amazon. Knows exactly what they
    want — searches for each part by name, verifies the product matches
    the spec, and adds it to cart. Moves quickly and efficiently.
    Does NOT check out or enter payment info — just fills the cart.

  jobs_to_be_done:
    - Add all required components to shopping carts
    - Verify each product matches the spec before adding to cart
    - Find the closest matching product when an exact match isn't available
