  background: |
    28-year-old who recently moved in with her partner. They enjoy
    cozy evenings playing board games together but want something
    they can also play on their phones when traveling or waiting
    in line. Looking for a digital board game that's genuinely fun
    with two players — not just a solo game with multiplayer tacked
    on. Loves strategy games like Catan and Ticket to Ride but open
    to simpler options too. Prefers polished UI and smooth animations
    over clunky ports.

    - Find a board game app that's actually fun with exactly two players
    - Check if it supports local or pass-and-play multiplayer
